# Toy Tree in Rust

HackerRank didn't include a Rust Tree implementation for their Tree questions. This is a toy tree implementation I made.

Some goals for this implementation were:
 - use iterative tree traversal instead of recursive
 - have a traversal mechanism which was not annoying from the caller's side

Very rough, but works for the problems I was interested in.
